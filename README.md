# electron-react-azure
Electron desktop application with React.js, Axios, Redux and React Bootstrap that allows you to connect to the Azure resful API and manage ARM-based virtual machines.

### Tasks

- [ ] Get tests running again
- [ ] Add virtual machine actions on the details overlay

### Getting started
Download or clone the source code:
```
git clone https://github.com/skiingandhiking/electron-react-azure.git
```
Once you have the source code downloaded locally be sure you have the latest version Node.js installed.  The easiest way to install Node.js is to download and run the appropriate installer from the [Node.js web site](https://nodejs.org).

Perform the following steps:

In the root directory of the project run the following command:
```
npm install
```
This will install all the necessary dependencies.  There are many options for running, testing and building this application.

To run the application in the Electron shell, perform the following steps:

1. From the project root directory, cd to the "app" folder
```
cd app
```
2. Run the following command:
```
npm run build
```
3. cd to the project root folder and run the following command
```
npm start
```
The Electron application will now start running with the latest React code.

To run just the React application in a browser, cd in to the app folder and run the following command:
```
npm start
```
